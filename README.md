# Full Stack Application

This is a basic full stack application built with:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB

## Setup Instructions

1. Install MongoDB on your system
2. Install Node.js if not already installed
3. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Create client directory and initialize React app
   npx create-react-app client
   cd client
   npm install axios
   cd ..
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the backend server and the React development server concurrently.
